🌟 Supplify – Purpose
Supplify is designed to streamline the management of relief supplies during natural disasters or emergency situations. It enables organized coordination of donations, inventory, camp logistics, and volunteer activities, ensuring that essential items are efficiently collected, tracked, and distributed to affected areas. The module bridges the gap between donors, camps, and volunteers to prevent shortages, avoid redundancies, and accelerate emergency response.

🧩 Supplify – Module Description
Supplify is a core module of the ResQconnect disaster management system. Built using Django and MySQL, it provides a robust backend for managing relief efforts through a clean, Bootstrap-powered interface. It includes:

Camp Management: Create and manage multiple camps with location-specific data.

Product Inventory: Maintain a dynamic catalog of required items (e.g., food, medicine, clothing).

Volunteer Management: Assign volunteers to specific camps with role-based access.

Submitted Items: Track and monitor incoming donations per camp and product.

Notification System: Instantly alert admins, volunteers, or users about urgent needs or updates.

Login Access Control: Secure logins for both admins and camp-specific volunteers, ensuring data privacy and access restrictions.

Together, these features empower disaster response teams to operate more effectively, reduce manual overhead, and serve affected communities faster.
